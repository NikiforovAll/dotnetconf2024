## Agenda

https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-conf-2024-celebrating-the-release-of-dotnet-9-save-the-date/

## Personal Highlights

The `‚≠ê` indicates my personal highlights. And the `üî•` indicates the most important features for me.

## C#

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-13

* üî•‚≠ê params collections - You can now use params with any recognized collection type, including System.Span<T>, System.ReadOnlySpan<T>, and types that implement System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> and have an Add method.
* üî•‚≠ê New lock object - The C# lock statement recognizes if the target of the lock is a Lock object.
* Implicit index access in initializers
* ref and unsafe in iterators and async methods
* allows ref struct
* More partial members

## Runtime 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/runtime

* üî•‚≠ê Features switches with support for trimming and AOT scenarios (good for library developers)
* üî•‚≠ê GC - Datas by default (from .NET 8) - DATAS helps most with "bursty" workloads where the heap size should be adjusted according to how demanding the workload is, particularly as demand decreases.
* üî•‚≠ê Performance improvements
  * Many more...
  * E.g:New exception hanlding - The new exception handling implementation is 2-4 times faster, per some exception handling micro-benchmarks. 

## Libraries

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/libraries

* Collections
  * üî•‚≠ê LINQ: `CountyBy` and `AggregateBy`, `Index<TSource>`

    * üî•‚≠ê JSON Sceham Exporter
    * JsonReader support reading multiple json documents, can be useful in jsonl, it also has streaming possible `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsyncEnumerable`
    * Respect nullable annotations - futher nullable support wihh `RespectNullableAnnotations`, `RespectRequiredConstructorParameters`, there is a feature switch to turn this globally.
    * Customizing enum member names
    * Customizing indentation
    * JsonObject property order manipulation
    * DeepEquals methods in JsonElement and JsonNode
    * Performance improvements
* Diagnostics

  * Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening
  * Logging source generator for partial classes with primary constructors
* Networking
  * SocketsHttpHandler is default in HttpClientFactory
  * System.Net.ServerSentEvents (used by OpenAI to stream text), protocal on top of HTTP
  * `TLS resume` with client certificates on Linux
  * WebSocket keep-alive ping and timeout
  * HttpClientFactory no longer logs header values by default
* Reflection
  * PersistedAssemblyBuilder 
  * TypeName is a parser for ECMA-335 type names that provides much the same functionality as System.Type 
* Regular expressions
  * `[GeneratedRegex]` on properties, because C# 13 supports partial properties (on mehtods it was available since .NET 7)
  * `Regex.EnumerateSplits` instead of `Regex.Split` for no allocations
* üî•‚≠ê System.Guid V7 - which "features a time-ordered value field derived from the widely implemented and well-known Unix Epoch timestamp source".
* System.IO - Starting in .NET 9 use zlib-ng
* New `Tensor<T>` type - good for AI - Represent and encode data such as text sequences (tokens), images, video, and audio; Efficiently manipulate higher-dimensional data.
* Threading
  * üî•‚≠ê `Task.WhenEach`
  * Prioritized unbounded channel for `System.Threading.Channels`

## SDK

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/sdk

* Run tests in parallel
* Terminal logger test display
* ‚≠ê.NET tool roll-forward
* üî•‚≠êTerminal logger
  * Clickable links, Duration timers for MSBuild tasks, Color coding of warning and error messages, The terminal logger now summarizes the total count of failures and warnings at the end of a build. It also shows errors that contain newlines.
* üî•‚≠ê NuGet security audits

## ASP.NET Core

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0?view=aspnetcore-9.0

* Blazor
  * .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid and Web App solution template
  * Static asset delivery optimization

  * ‚≠ê Handle keyboard composition events in Blazor
* SignalR
  * Polymorphic type support in SignalR Hubs
  * üî•‚≠ê Improved Activities for SignalR
  * SignalR supports trimming and Native AOT - Continuing the Native AOT journey started in .NET 8, we have enabled trimming and native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation support for both SignalR client and server scenarios. With limitations*
* Minimal APIs
  * üî•‚≠ê Added InternalServerError and InternalServerError<TValue> to TypedResults
  * Call `ProducesProblem` and `ProducesValidationProblem` on route groups
  * `Problem` and `ValidationProblem` result types support construction with `IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, object?>>` values
* OpenAPI
  * üî•‚≠ê Built-in support for OpenAPI document generation via the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` package

  * `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` supports trimming and Native AOT (interesting)
* Authentication and authorization
  * OpenIdConnectHandler adds support for Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)
  * OIDC and OAuth Parameter Customization
  * Configure HTTP.sys extended authentication flags
* üî•‚≠ê New HybridCache library - `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid` (probably not mature as `HybridCache` anyway)

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew

* Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
* üî•‚≠ê AOT and pre-compiled queries - there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes to allow EF Core to run without just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Instead, EF compile ahead-of-time (AOT) everything needed to run queries in the application.
* ‚≠ê LINQ and SQL translation
* Complex types: GroupBy and ExecuteUpdate support
* Prune unneeded elements from SQL
* And many more
* ‚≠ê Improved data seeding - `UseAsyncSeeding` - The new seeding methods are called as part of `EnsureCreated` operation, `Migrate` and `dotnet ef database update`
